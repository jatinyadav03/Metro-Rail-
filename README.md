# MetroApp

The Metro Route Optimization System is a graph-based (C++) application designed to find the shortest path between metro stations. Leveraging Dijkstra's algorithm, the system calculates either the shortest distance or the quickest time between any two stations on a metro network. This tool is ideal for optimizing travel routes and improving commuter efficiency.


## Features

- Shortest Path Calculation
- Dynamic Cost Calculation
- Efficient Pathfinding
- Graph Representation
- Flexible Input Handling
- Detailed Path Information


## Used cases

This project is used by:

- Commuters seeking the fastest or shortest route between stations.
- Metro system operators analyzing travel times and optimizing routes.
- Travel planners looking to enhance commuter experience and efficiency.


## Usage/Examples

```javascript
import Component from 'my-project'

 while (true) {
        cout << "Menu:\n";
        cout << "1. List all stations\n";
        cout << "2. Show the metro map\n";
        cout << "3. Get shortest distance between two stations\n";
        cout << "4. Get shortest time between two stations\n";
        cout << "5. Get shortest path (distance-wise)\n";
        cout << "6. Get shortest path (time-wise)\n";
        cout << "7. Exit\n";
        cout << "Enter your choice: ";
        int choice;
        cin >> choice;

```
